            >This week on Let's Talk LoCo, your host Lauren Colvin is joined by Flynn Hayward to talk all about Coaching! Flynn Hayward is an actress, entrepreneur, and life coach located in Los Angeles, CA. She attended UCLA where she majored in Musical Theater. Throughout college, Flynn hustled and made a way for herself by being shameless in asking for what she wanted and not letting fear of failure hold her back


            After graduation, Flynn immediately dove into the LA acting world, booking the first commercial she auditioned for! Since then, she has acted and modeled for commercials and print for various companies including Toyota, Xfinity, Coldwell Banker, eBay, Chase Bank, and more!
            
            
            Considering acting work comes and goes, Flynn decided to use her strengths of productivity, organization, and motivation to create her own life coaching business where she encourages driven creatives to build confidence, authentically express themselves, get specific about their future goals, and discover the steps needed to make them a reality. Time to get talking LoCo about Coaching with Flynn!</span
