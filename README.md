## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
and have 3 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)                         
**RESOLUTION**: If you dont care about the changes you made on github.com and just want to override it with your local files then we can use git push origin main --force
